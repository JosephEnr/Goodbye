    Hey ms Its me Joe and just wanted to say you da best and we will miss you. I will never forget your iconic lines like "morning" and "take your laptops out". Also wanted to wish you good luck on what I heard is a girl, woooo!!! [Insert celebration noise here]. I know you have to go but just so you know no one can replace you.
      -sincerely Jo
